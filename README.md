# Devnagri-alphabets
Identifying alphabets of Devnagari script

We have to classify alphabets and identify each letter.

First Import required libraries.

Then I intialised CNN with Sequential class, convolution layer, pooling layer, flattening layer and output dense layer.

I compiled CNN using adam optimiser. Resized training and test tests fitted with classifer and validated; got accuracy of 95.45 on testing and 96.81 on validation.

Hence model is performing well and fixed it with CNN.

As output is not binary class_mode is categorical.
